In the short time that I've been a member of the Novembre lab, I learned more than I could have imagined. It was the unparalleled mentorship I received from both John Novembre and Dan Rice that helped me construct this foundation for my scientific career.

From my first day in lab, John has encouraged me to be inquisitive. He has been a fantastic instructor in the practice of science. I especially admire John's commitment to teaching and preparing his trainees to become effective presenters. I will miss our paper jams and coffee mug awards. 

Dan took me under his wing when I knew essentially nothing about population genetics, making this dissertation possible. Dan's patience knows no bounds and he has a gift for making extremely challenging concepts comprehensible unlike anyone I have ever met. I am immensely grateful to have met and have learned from Dan, without whom I would never have found the Novembre lab. 

I also want to thank Dmitry Kondrashov for his continued guidance and support throughout my years in college, and for connecting me with Dan. Thank you to my office-mates Jonatas Cesar and Arjun Biddanda and to the Novembre lab and CSLC 4th floor supergroup. 

Thank you to my honors thesis committee: Dan Nicolae, Matthias Steinr√ºcken, and Jeremy Berg.
